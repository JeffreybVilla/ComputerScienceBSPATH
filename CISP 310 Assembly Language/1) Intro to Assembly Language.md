# What is assembly language and its importance?
    - Processor-Dependent
    - Low-Level Programming Language
    - Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program refereed to as an assembler.




    - Each family of CPUs has its own set of instructions or its own Assembly Language for handling various operations.
      - Getting input from keyboard
      - Displaying information on screen
      - Performing various tasks





    - There are many different types of Assembly Languages for different types of CPU Architectures.
    - Popular Architectures today:
      - ARM: Phones
      - MIPS: Video Game Consoles
      - x86: Intel PCs and others 16-bit to 64-bit





    - Set of instructions written in assembly language are called "machine language instructions"
    - Our processors (CPU) only understands machine language instructions which are stringsn of 1's & 0's.
    - Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utlitiy program referred to as an assembler. 




## Why Assembly?
    - Directly communicate with hardware using human readable text.
    - Direct hardware manipulation.
    - Access to specialized processor instructions.
    - Writing device drivers
    - Operating system design.
    - Embeded system program, etc.


## Will help you understand
    - How data is represented in memory and other external devices. 
    - How programs interface with your operating system, processor, and BIOS. 
    - How the processor accesses and executes instructions.
    - How instructions access and process data.
    - How a program accesses external devices. 







# Basics of Computer Hardware
## Main internal hardware
    - Processor:
    - Memory:
    - Registers: Are processor components that hold data and addresses.

    In order to execute a program the system copies this into an internal memory and then the processor executes the program instructions.


## Storage Units
    Computer storage unit is called a bit.
    A bit can be 0 (OFF) or 1 (ON).
    8 bits = 1 byte.
    2 byte = Word.

    Word: 2-byte data item
    Doubleword: 4-byte (32-bit) data item
    Quadword: 8-byte (64-bit) data item
    Paragraph: 16-byte (128 bit) area
    Kilobyte: 1024 bytes
    Megabytes: 1,048,576 bytes
