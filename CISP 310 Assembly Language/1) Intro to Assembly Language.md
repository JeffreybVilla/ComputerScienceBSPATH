# What is assembly language and its importance?

- Processor-Dependent
- Low-Level Programming Language
- Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program refereed to as an assembler.




- Each family of CPUs has its own set of instructions or its own Assembly Language for handling various operations.
  - Getting input from keyboard
  - Displaying information on screen
  - Performing various tasks





- There are many different types of Assembly Languages for different types of CPU Architectures.
- Popular Architectures today:
  - ARM: Phones
  - MIPS: Video Game Consoles
  - x86: Intel PCs and others 16-bit to 64-bit





- Set of instructions written in assembly language are called "machine language instructions"
- Our processors (CPU) only understands machine language instructions which are stringsn of 1's & 0's.
- Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utlitiy program referred to as an assembler. 




## Why Assembly?
- Directly communicate with hardware using human readable text.
- Direct hardware manipulation.
- Access to specialized processor instructions.
- Writing device drivers
- Operating system design.
- Embeded system program, etc.


## Will help you understand
- How data is represented in memory and other external devices. 
- How programs interface with your operating system, processor, and BIOS. 
- How the processor accesses and executes instructions.
- How instructions access and process data.
- How a program accesses external devices.
