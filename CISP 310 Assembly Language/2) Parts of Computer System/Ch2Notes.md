# x86 Registers
## General Purpose Registers
- The EAX, EDX, ECX, EBX, EBP, EDI, and ESI registers are 32-bit general-purpose registers, used for temporary data storage and memory access.

- The AX, DX, CX, BX, BP, DI, and SI registers are 16-bit equivalents of the above, they represent the low-order 16 bits of 32-bit registers.

- The AH, DH, CH, and BH registers represent the high-order 8 bits of the corresponding registers.

- Similarly, AL, DL, CL, and BL represent the low-order 8 bits of the registers.
