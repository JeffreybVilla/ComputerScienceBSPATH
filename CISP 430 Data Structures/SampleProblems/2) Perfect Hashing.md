# Searching & Hashing

***Consider the Perfect Hashing Implementation. Explain the difference between a lookup-table based
perfect hash function and an algorithmic hash function. Discuss the pros and cons of each approach.***



# Hashing HW
A perfect hash function for a set S is a hash function that maps unmistakable elements in S to an arrangement of whole numbers, without any crashes. In numerical terms, it is an injective function.

Perfect hash functions might be utilized to execute a query table with steady most pessimistic scenario get to time. A flawless hash function has a large number of an indistinguishable applications from other hash functions, however with the preferred standpoint that no crash determination must be actualized.

Algorithmic hash function is reliant on the calculation time complexity
